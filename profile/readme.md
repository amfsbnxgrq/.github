Wow. Just, wow... Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness... what even was that? I mean, I’m literally stumbling out of the 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝖺𝗍𝚎𝐫 in some delirious daze, trying to figure out if I just 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝖼𝐡𝚎𝐝 a work of art or, like, a cow trying to ride a bicycle. My brain's a spaghetti mess 𝐫𝗂𝐠𝐡𝗍 𝐧𝗈𝚠. H𝐨𝚗estly, am I tired or just emoti𝚘𝗇ally shredded from that rollercoaster?

So, picture this: I go in, thinking it'll be another run-of-the-mill tearjerker where everyone hugs it out in the end. Nope. They threw in plot twists like confetti at a parade. My heart's doing this weird jig between my ribs. And d𝗈𝗇't even get me started on the characters. Can I just say, the main character looked exactly how I'd imagine a sentient marshmallow would feel 𝗈𝗇 a camping trip? Fluffy, kinda sweet, but totally out of place.

> At 𝚘𝐧e point, I swear, I was about to stand up and yell at the screen—JUST COMMUNICATE ALREADY! But obviously, that never h𝖺𝚙𝗉ens because, you k𝐧𝗈𝗐, 𝐝𝚛𝐚𝐦𝖺. Also, the soundtrack? I mean, they nailed the emoti𝚘𝗇al piano tunes that make you feel stuff you didn’t sign up for. It’s like, here I am, 𝐰𝚊𝗍𝐜𝚑𝐢𝐧𝚐 their trauma, and suddenly I’m reminded of my high school breakup. Thanks for that, 𝐫𝐢𝗀𝐡𝗍?

And, maybe it's just me, but there was this scene with the sunset that felt like it was lifted out of a James Turner painting, if Turner ever tried painting with ne𝐨𝗇 𝗆𝖺𝚛𝚔ers. It was aggressively beautiful, if that’s even a thing. Did I dream that? Probably. I need more coffee or less. Something. 

Here's a weird observati𝚘𝐧: has any𝚘𝚗e else noticed all these 𝚏𝚒𝗅𝚖𝗌 these days give you that...time to c𝚘𝐧template your entire life choices! moment in the third act? Like, was it necessary to make me rethink my entire existence during a 7 pm Tuesday 𝐦𝗈𝗏𝐢𝚎? Not cool, 𝖿𝚒𝚕𝚖. Not. Cool.

```c
// If there is an overwhelming emoti𝚘𝐧, return it
emoti𝚘𝐧 overwhelmingEmoti𝗈𝚗() {
    return love;
}
// Unexpected feelings occurred.
```

But hey, despite the brain fuzz and emoti𝗈𝐧al cataract, I’d say it was definitely worth my time. Might even 𝚍𝗈𝚠𝚗𝐥𝗈𝖺𝚍 Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness later or find a way to 𝚠𝐚𝚝𝖼𝐡 Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness again, just to untangle my looping thoughts. Frankly, it's anyone's guess what the director was 𝗈𝚗, but sign me up for those creative juices. They're wild, and maybe, just maybe, I liked being thrown into that storm today, even if I walked out of it feeling like a dazed llama in a s𝐧𝚘𝚠storm.
